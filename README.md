# wp-html-email

**WordPress HTML Email Generator** - a wee theme that allows users to create, customize, and manage webpages that can then be sent by email (using a service, or in a pinch something hackier like pasting into an email client, or something like the native _âŒ˜+i_ function in Safari). 

A lot of the WordPressy parts of this code are borrowed from the iconic WordPress theme [twentyseventeen](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/), and a lot of the HTML Emailly parts of this code are from [Mail Chimp templates](https://mailchimp.com/features/email-templates/), leaving in their custom mc tags.


## Installation

Jam the `html-email` theme folder into your `wp-config/themes` folder, activate, build some pages, send. This very basic theme only has the one template, but hopefully is organized and documented in such a way as to be a decent starting point.


### HTML Email Templates

There are a lot of great resources online, and hopefully this will be a good starting point if you want to use WP as a CMS for the emails. HTML Emails can be tricky documents, and for good reason. Email clients are notorious for rendering modern code poorly or unpredictably. It's a tricky business that is simple if you know about a million facts. I like to make use of the generous work done by niche experts. Did I mention [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/) made some [templates](mailchimp.com/features/email-templates/) and [tools](https://mailchimp.com/features/email-designer/)? When someone builds a heavily tested table layout HTML Email template there's no need to be subtle with the shout outs. Heroes.

### To DO

- Clean out functions /assets, /inc
- Customize width, fonts, colors
- Test Featured image
- Test custom logo
- wire up sidebar
- Add .dim, .subtitle ?
